    My parents were poor in Pakistan and how my dad worked hard to get to where he is now. He is living the American Dream. I don’t want all of my parent’s hard work to be in vain. I want to make sure I can pay them back for every single thing they have done for me.

    I was called “Gifted and Talented” from a very young age and I have lived up to it. I have always been a straight A student who has always worked hard. I have spectacular grades and attained many achievements and merit awards. I always made my education a priority. I love the satisfaction of getting amazing grades and making my parents proud. I WILL pay them back.

    I like to consider myself an extroverted introvert. I love peace and quiet. Some people hate being alone with their thoughts, but I love it. I can focus and think clearly. Thinking, contemplating, pondering, and calculating. When I’m alone, I feel like I am truly myself. I let my imagination run wild. My mind chisels away at quandaries and paradoxes that I didn’t even previously know existed, or maybe they are just a creation of my own mind. My mental gymnastics flow like a ballerina dancing to Tchaikovsky in the Bolshoi Theater. Although I love my alone time, I also love being with my friends. Trying out new restaurants, watching movies, talking about current events, the universe, and catching up. Sometimes I like to share my cognitive experiences with them and hope they can grasp the depth of the detail I envisioned.

    In high school, I started to develop my passions. Math was always “just another class” that I had to take in my years of schooling. That is until in precalculus when my teacher hinted at the idea of being able to calculate the exact slope of a curve at any point of a function. Not a secant slope. Not the average slope. But the exact slope at a given point. This absolutely blew my mind. This notion picked at my brain for days. I had to figure this out. I fell into the deep rabbit hole of calculus. I had to know more.

    Mathematics wasn’t my only passion. I have been a band student since the 3rd grade. I learned treble clef and the recorder in the 3rd grade. The following year I learned how to play trombone and never stopped since then. I was in band in the 4th and 5th grade. In 6th grade I continued with band, but decided to join an after school band as well. This band played much more advanced music. I remember one piece we played was a watered down version of Johannes Brahms Hungarian Dance No. 5. I used to think it was so hard, but the satisfaction of finally being able to play it was immeasurable. The following year I decided to join an afterschool “rock band” where we played big hits from the time such as Coldplay’s Viva La Vida. I enjoyed playing trombone so much that I continued to play in high school. The following year I decided to join the Marching Band as well, where I learned to play the baritone, but I didn’t stop there. By my senior year, I was in the Wind Ensemble, Marching Band, Jazz Band, S!NG Band, and Spring Musical Band. In college, I joined the Hunter Symphony. On my own I also learned how to play guitar. Playing guitar is one of my favorite pastimes. I use it as an artistic outlet, a way to express myself. I have played all kinds of music in all my years as a musician, from Mozart and Holst, to Queen and Black Sabbath, to Duke Ellington and Wynton Marsalis, to Broadway Musicals and student made pieces. Each of those pieces were special in their own way. I believe there are 2 universal languages: Music and Math.
